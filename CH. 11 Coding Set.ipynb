    "Write an Employee class that keeps data attributes for the following pieces of information:\n",
    "• Employee name\n",
    "• Employee number\n",
    "Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that is a subclass of the Employee class.\n",
    "The ProductionWorker class should keep data attributes for the following information:\n",
    "• Shift number (an integer, such as 1, 2, or 3)\n",
    "• Hourly pay rate\n",
    "The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift attribute will hold an\n",
    "integer value representing the shift that the employee works. The day shift is shift 1 and the\n",
    "night shift is shift 2. Write the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for each class.\n",
